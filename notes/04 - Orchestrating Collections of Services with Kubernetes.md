Docker images: think of them as blueprints, for example a blueprint for creating a cow.

Docker daemon: think of it as corral for letting the cows run wild.

Docker swarm (and Kubernetes): think of it as a rancher that manages the cows.

Whenever I create a kubernetes deployment,  it will auto download image from docker hub?

- It depends on the ImagePullPolicy of the Pod
- The default pull policy is IfNotPresent
- It will try to download the image if it’s not already present on the node
